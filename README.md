# OnTopReplica

**A real-time always-on-top ‚Äúreplica‚Äù of a window of your choice, for Windows Vista, 7, 8, or 10.**

This simple utility application shows a blank always-on-top window by default.
Users can pick any other window of the system to have an always up-to-date clone of the original window shown always-on-top.
Very useful for monitoring background processes, wrangling with complex multi-window games or tools, watching Youtube videos while working, and so on.

**üì¢ Features:**

* Clone any of your windows and keep it¬†*always-on-top*¬†while working with other windows,
* Select a subregion of the cloned window, which:
  * Can be stored for future use,
  * Can use *relative* coordinates from the target window‚Äôs borders.
* *Auto-resizing* (fit the original window, half, quarter and fullscreen mode),
* Position lock on any corner of your screen,
* Adjustable opacity,
* ‚Äú*Click forwarding*‚Äù, allows to interact with the cloned window,
* ‚Äú*Click-through*‚Äù, makes the replica ignore any mouse interaction (turns **OnTopReplica** into an overlay if set together with partial opacity),
* ‚Äú*Group switch*‚Äù-mode automatically switches through a group of windows while you use them,
* Non-invasive installation doesn‚Äôt require administrator elevation.

## Requirements

* Microsoft Windows Vista or greater (the application makes use of native DWM Thumbnails to create replicas),
* Microsoft .NET Framework 4.0/4.5.
* Desktop Composition (a.k.a. Windows *Aero*) enabled.
